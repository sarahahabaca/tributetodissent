            <caption class="mothers-container">Mothers of the Plaza De Mayo,protesting the
                dissappearance of their children by the Argentinian Government.
                Women had organized to gather, holding a vigil, while also trying to learn what had happened to their
                adult children during the 1970s and 1980s. They began to gather for this every Thursday, from 1977-2006
                at the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires, in front of the Casa Rosada presidential palace, in public
                defiance of the government's law against mass assemblies. Wearing white headscarves to symbolize the
                diapers of their lost children, embroidered with the names and dates of birth of their
                offspring, now young adults, the mothers marched in twos in solidarity to protest the denials of their
                children's existence or their mistreatment by the military regime. Despite personal risks, they wanted
                to hold the government accountable for the human rights violations which were committed in the Dirty War
                where as many as 30,000 people “disappeared”. Most are assumed to have been taken on "Death Flights"
                over the Atlantic and pushed out.
