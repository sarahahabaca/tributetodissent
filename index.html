                    <h3>Tiannemen Square Student-led Democracy Protests</h3>

                    <p class="description-container">The Tiananmen Square protests, known in Chinese as the June Fourth
                        Incident, were student-led
                        demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square during 1989. In what is known as the Tiananmen Square
                        Massacre, troops armed with assault riffles and accompanied by tanks fired at the demonstrators
                        and
                        those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. The protests started on 15
                        April
                        and were forcibly suppressed on 4 June when the government declared martial law and sent the
                        Peoples
                        Liberation Army to occupy parts of central Beijing. Estimates of the death toll vary from
                        several
                        hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded. The popular national movement inspired
                        by
                        the Beijing protests is sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement or Tiananmen Square
                        Incident.

                <div class="description-container">
                    <p>Prior to Hong Kong’s transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, people in the territory were
                        promised that rights and freedoms would be ensured under Hong Kong and international law. Over
                        the next two decades, people used peaceful means to press for these rights, but the Hong Kong
                        and Beijing governments have repeatedly backtracked. In February 2019, Hong Kong authorities
                        proposed legal revisions allowing criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, where
                        due process rights are routinely violated. This prompted massive, largely peaceful protests
                        starting in June.</p>

                    <h3>Black Lives Matter Protests</h3>
                    <h4>Following the police killing of George Floyd</h4>
                    <p>On May 25, Minneapolis resident George Floyd was pinned facedown on the ground, in handcuffs, by
                        a
                        white police officer who pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes.
                        Floyd, a
                        46-year-old black man, was suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. He was unresponsive when
                        paramedics arrived, and he was pronounced dead later.

                        Unrest erupted in Minneapolis, where protesters set fire to buildings, and in several
                        cities across the country and the globe. </p>

                    <h2>Iranian Protests For Womens Rights</h2>
                    <h3>Following the death of Mahsa Amini</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>On 16 September 2022, a 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in Tehran, Iran under suspicious
                        circumstances
                        allegedly due to police brutality.
                        The Morality Police of Iran's Law Enforcement Command, arrested Amini for not wearing the hijab
                        in
                        accordance with government standards. Police said she had a heart attack at a station, fell on
                        the
                        floor, and died after two days in a coma. Eyewitnesses and women who were detained with Amini
                        said
                        she was severely beaten, which, in addition to her leaked medical scans, led independent
                        observers
                        to diagnose cerebral hemorrhage and stroke.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Amini's death resulted in a series of large scale protests across the country which garnered
                        international attention.
                        The government of Iran attempted to suppress the protests, shooting protesters with birdshot and
                        metal pellets, deploying tear gas and water cannons, blocking access to many apps including
                        Instagram and WhatsApp, and limiting internet accessibility to reduce protesters' ability to
                        organize. These may be the most severe internet restrictions in Iran since 2019, when the
                        internet
                        was shut down completely.
